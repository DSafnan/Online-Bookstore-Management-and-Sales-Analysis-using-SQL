📚 Online Bookstore Management and Sales Analysis using SQL
📝 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to manage and analyze data for an online bookstore. It involves creating and populating relational database tables for books, customers, and orders, followed by executing a series of queries to derive meaningful business insights from the data.

🧱 Database Structure
The project uses a PostgreSQL database named OnlineBookstore, containing the following tables:

Books: Stores details of books such as title, author, genre, published year, price, and stock.

Customers: Stores customer information including name, email, phone, and location.

Orders: Tracks purchases made by customers, including quantity, total amount, and order date.

📂 Data Import
Data is imported from CSV files using the COPY command:

Books.csv

Customers.csv

Orders.csv

Each CSV file corresponds to a table and is loaded with appropriate data types and constraints.

🔍 SQL Queries Performed
📌 Basic Queries
Retrieve all books in a specific genre (e.g., Fiction).

List books published after a certain year.

Filter customers by country (e.g., Canada).

Fetch orders placed in a specific month (e.g., November 2023).

Calculate total available stock of all books.

Identify the most expensive book.

List orders with quantity greater than 1.

Retrieve orders with total amount exceeding $20.
